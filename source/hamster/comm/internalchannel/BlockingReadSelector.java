/*
Helper for channels.

Use a selector:
	can wait for timeouts.
	can interrupt the selector in case the thread needs to shut down or for any other reason.

For a standard read-write helper, read non-blocking using the selector then write in blocking?

Read method in a helper:
	Data channel into nonblocking.
	Control channel already in nonblocking.
	Select
		Data channel ready - mark as readable.  Put the channel back into blocking.
		Control channel ready - read control code and do something with it (1 = shutdown?)

	Return.
	â€¦
	Channel is readable, transfer data from it.
	Can write outgoing data to blocking channel after processing read data.
